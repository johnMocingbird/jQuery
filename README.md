# JavaScript and jQuery Comparison

When you begin learning jquery. I highly recommed you just consider what do you want to do in regualar javascript. Then convert that to jquery.
For example. if you need to use document.getElementById you could simply google "how to.. document.getElementById jquery"

See the script file for a "translation" of javascript to jquery
